# Comp221--Final-Project
Analyze Arab Spring Twitter Data
Author: Phuc Nguyen, Olivia Newman

This is the final project for Algorithm Design and Analysis course at Macalester College. 
The goal of this program is to use Maximum Likelihood Estimate to assemble Bigrams and Trigrams from tweet dataset into sentences that reflect the common theme of these tweets.
We retrieved tweets using Twitter API. We found that the pseudo sentences generated by our program reflect themes relevant to Arab Spring such as casualty report, bombing events.
